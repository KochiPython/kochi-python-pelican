When geeks meet, time and topics wait for none. So it wasn't surprising that, instead of an hour, the meeting stretched for three hours. Starting off with a cup of tea and introductions to break the ice, we discussed about the things that we currently looking into. As the chats progressed, we came to know about the varied mix of experience and work environments in our team. From entrepreneurs like Matthew, Rahul and Arun to the Indian navy personnel like Naveen and senior developers like Renju made up our team.

Along the way, while discussing about other meetups like KeralaJS, GDG(Google Developers Group), we decided to set the meetup date as every first Saturday of the month starting from 6th of December. Next was the location of the meetup which was fixed at Nuventure Technology, Kaloor. In between, discussions about Kivy, Docker, Nodejs, Image processing libraries like OpenCV and Pillow popped up. Speaking of discussions, these needed energy provided by another round of coffee, tea and sodas along with French fries.

The next thing was the meetup sessions. We decided to allow 2 medium-length sessions, of about 30~40 mins, with a few small filler sessions of 5 mins.

Other take-aways from the meeting included

- Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/kochi.python">Kochi Python Meetup</a>
- Tweeting from <a href="https://twitter.com/kochi_python" target="_blank">Kochi Python</a>

To sum it up,

Next meetup date - 6th of December, 2014<br />
Location - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nuventuretech">Nuventure Technology Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</a>

Summary: Third meetup report, held at Phases, Ernakulam on February 7, 2015


Our third meetup took place on 8th of February, 2015 at <a href="http://phases.dk/en/" target="_blank" title="Phases.dk">Phases</a>, Ernakulam. There were around 40 people who participated in the event.

The meeting began at 3.30PM with the session of <a href="http://nibrahim.net.in" target="_blank" title="Noufal Ibrahim">Mr. Noufal Ibrahim</a> on 'Itertools and Generators'. The session went ballistic in a matter of minutes. The topic was quite advanced as well as informative to the core. Starting with a simple generator with yield programs, we then dived into iteration patterns. There, we spend some time for a specific module called itertools and its methods.  At about 4.40PM we took a break, followed by a small session to know more about <a href="http://phases.dk/en/" target="_blank" title="Phases.dk">Phases</a> and their expertise. Later, we continued on with Noufal's session by discussing collections, GIL, Gevent, Coroutine, subroutine, parallel processing, concurrency and a whole lot of stuffs. Noufal is just fantastic at what he is doing and we rant him out with lots tough of questions. He introduced python recipes from <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh" target="_blank" title="Raymond Hettinger">Raymond Hettinger</a> for more references. The presentation was with live coding so there aren't any slides to share. You may follow him on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/noufalibrahim" target="_blank" title="Noufal Ibrahim">@noufalibrahim</a>.

The next session was by <a href="https://twitter.com/praseed3point14" title="Praseed Pai" target="_blank">Mr. Praseed Pai</a> introducing his project named 'SLANG for DOTNET' compiler which was later ported to python as 'SLANG for Python' by two python guys. They shared their experience while porting the code to python. He reccomended a book named 'Structure and Interpretation of computer programs' which he referred to while creating the project and also the porting. We had a lot of discussion about compilers, interpreters, static typing, dynamic typing, etc. with simple demonstrations that can be explained even to grandmas! You can learn more about his work on his <a href="http://praseedp.blogspot.in/" target="_blank" title="Praseed Pai">website</a>.


The Meetup ended at 6.30PM with very little snacks left! ;)
